        <p>If you fix the ID to make sure it's the exact same one, the other thing
             to check is to make sure that the exists by the time the JS line 
                 is called. You can do this by moving to the end of your
                  or by wrapping the call 
        in a handler that makes sure it's only called after all the HTML is loaded.
